The teacher said, \"Very good\" and April fell back asleep.\n\nA while later the teacher asked April, \"Who is our Lord and Saviour,\" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. \n\nOnce again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. \"JESUS CHRIST!\" shouted April and the teacher said, \"very good,\" and April fell back to sleep. \n\nThen the teacher asked April a third question. \"What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?” \n\nAnd again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, \"IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!” \n\nThe Teacher fainted.",

      "joke": "Due to the current financial situation caused by the slowdown in the economy, the Government has decided to implement a scheme to put workers of 50 years of age and above on early, mandatory retirement, thus creating jobs and reducing unemployment.\n\nThis scheme will be known as RAPE (Retire Aged People Early). Persons selected to be RAPED can apply to the Government to be considered for the SHAFT program (Special Help After Forced Termination).\n\nPersons who have been RAPED and SHAFTED will be reviewed under the SCREW program (System Covering Retired-Early Workers).\n\nA person may be RAPED once, SHAFTED twice and SCREWED as many times as the Government deems appropriate.\n\nPersons who have been RAPED could get AIDS (Additional Income for Dependents & Spouse) or HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel Early Severance).\n\nObviously persons who have AIDS or HERPES will not be SHAFTED or SCREWED any further by the Government.\n\nPersons who are not RAPED and are staying on will receive as much SHIT (Special High Intensity Training) as possible. The Government has always prided itself on the amount of SHIT it gives our citizens.\n\nShould you feel that you do not receive enough SHIT, please bring this to the attention of your Congressional Representative, who has been trained to give you all the SHIT you can handle.\n\nSincerely, The Committee for Economic Value of Individual Lives (E.V.I.L.)\n",

Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin engine Chris Craft.

He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our faiths. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us.

I pulled out the wine and host to show that through the perfect sacrifice Jesus has atoned for our sins, but the rabbi pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he'd won. \"I haven't a clue,\" said the rabbi. \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews but I told him emphatically that we were staying right here.\" \"And then what?\" asked a woman. \"Who knows?\" said the rabbi. \"He took out his lunch, so I took out mine.\n",

I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.\n\nI have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice.\n\nBut I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am. But it's not only the passion...Dad she's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy.\n\nShe owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.\n\nStacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.\n\nWe'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.\n\nIn the meantime we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it.\n\nDon't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.\n\nSomeday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren. Love, Your Son John\n\nPS. Dad, none of the above is true.

I was reading the note out loud to her and she fainted before I could get to the end. I couldn't feel her heart beating but I hope it's just my clumsiness. I have to keep this note short because she's losing blood, She fell right on her head. Pray for your mother to be in good health.\n\nPS: We're at a restaurant, none of this is true.

      "joke": "When you occasionally have a really bad day, and you just need to take it out on someone, don't take it out on someone you know. Take it out on someone you don't know, but you know deserves it. I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call Id forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered, saying Hello.\n\nI politely said, This is Rick. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter? Suddenly, a manic voice yelled out in my ear, Get the right f***ing number! and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. When I tracked down Robyns correct number to call her, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.\n\nAfter hanging up with her, I decided to call the wrong number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, Youre an ahole! and hung up. I wrote his number down with the word a hole next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, Youre an a**hole! It always cheered me up.\n\nWhen Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic ahole calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program? He yelled NO! and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, Thats because youre an ahole! and hung up.\n\nOne day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that Id been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a For Sale sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number.\n\nA couple of days later, right after calling the first ahole, I thought that Id better call the BMW ahole, too. I said, Is this the man with the black BMW for sale? He said, Yes, it is. I then asked, Can you tell me where I can see it? He said, Yes, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. Its a yellow ranch style house, and the cars parked right out in front. I asked, What's your name? He said, My name is Don Hansen. I asked, Whens a good time to catch you, Don? He said, Im home every evening after five. I said, Listen, Don, can I tell you something? He said, Yes? I said, Don, youre an a**hole! Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.\n\nNow, when I had a problem, I had two a holes to call. Then I came up with an idea I called a hole #1. He said, Hello. I said, Youre an ahole! but I didn't hang up. He asked, Are you still there? I said, Yeah! He screamed, Stop calling me! I said, Make me. He asked, Who are you? I said, My name is Don Hansen. He said, Yeah? Where do you live? I said, ahole, I live at 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax. A yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front. He said, I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers. I said, Yeah, like I'm really scared, a**hole and hung up.\n\nThen I called a hole #2. He said, Hello? I said, Hello, ahole. He yelled, If I ever find out who you are I said, You'll what? He exclaimed, I'll kick your ass! I answered, Well, a**hole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now.\n\nThen I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oak Tree Blvd. in Fairfax to kill my gay lover. Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oak Tree Blvd in Fairfax.\n\nI quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax. I got there just in time to watch the two a**holes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew. NOW I feel much better. :lol: :lol: :lol:\n",

Please come up with a fee for usage, and I'll pay you. Regards, Alan.\n\nTHE ACTIONS: Bob, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, and shot his neighbor dead. He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa.

I'd lose my job! What if something should happen?' protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning.\n\n'Who's going to tell?' says the Pope with a smile.\n\nReluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the Pope climbs in behind the wheel. The driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 205 kms. (Remember, the Pope is German.)\n\n'Please slow down, Your Holiness!' pleads the worried driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens.\n\n'Oh, dear God, I'm going to lose my license -- and my job!' moans the driver.\n\nThe Pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches, but the cop takes one look at him, goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio.\n\n'I need to talk to the Chief,' he says to the dispatcher.\n\nThe Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going 205 kph.\n\n'So bust him,' says the Chief.\n\n'I don't think we want to do that, he's really important,' said the cop.\n\nThe Chief exclaimed,' All the more reason!' 'No, I mean really important,' said the cop with a bit of persistence.\n\nThe Chief then asked, 'Who do you have there, the mayor?'\n\nCop: 'Bigger.'\n\nChief: 'A senator?'\n\nCop: 'Bigger.'\n\nChief: 'The Prime Minister?'\n\nCop: 'Bigger.'\n\n'Well,' said the Chief, 'who is it?'\n\nCop: 'I think it's God!'\n\nThe Chief is even more puzzled and curious, 'What makes you think it's God?'\n\nCop: 'His chauffeur is the Pope!'\n",

      "joke": "Dearest Ones:   The other day I went up to a local Christian bookstore and saw a \"Honk if you love Jesus\" bumper sticker.\n\nI was feeling particularly sassy that day, because I had just come from a thrilling choir practice followed by a powerful prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.\n\nI was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is, and I didn't notice that the light had changed.\n\nIt is a good thing someone else loves Jesus; because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed. I found that LOTS of people love Jesus.  Why, while I was sitting there, the nice man behind started honking like crazy, and he leaned out of his window and screamed, \"for the love of God, GO! GO!\"   What an exuberant cheerleader he was for the Lord..\n\nEveryone started honking!  I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people.\n\nI even honked my horn a few times to share in the love.  There must have been a man from Florida back there, because I heard him yelling something about a sunny beach.\n\nI saw another man waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.  When I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was an Hawaiian good luck sign or something.\n\nWell, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.\n\nMy grandson burst out laughing; why even he was enjoying this religious experience.\n\nA couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed.\n\nSo I waved to all my sisters and brothers, smiled at them all, and drove on through the intersection.\n\nI noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again, and I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window, and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!\n",

While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\"\n\nThe young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\"\n\n\"Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\"\n\n\"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the banker proudly.\n\nThe moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\"\n\n\"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!\"\n\nJust then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!\n\n\"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!\n\nHe's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!\n\nThe Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... my... suspenders... from... your.... side view mirror.\"\n",

We're planning a trip to Rome as we've always wanted to go to Italy and really experience some authentic Italian food!\"\n\n\"Ahh, don't bother\" says the barber. \"The whole city is just full of McDonald's on every corner and there's nowhere to get authentic Italian food there any more!\"\n\n\"Oh…\" says the man. \"Well, me and the wife are also big fans of architecture. We'd love to see the old ruins and remains of ancient Rome and really soak in some of those fantastic sights!\"\n\n\"Ahh, don't bother\" replies the barber. \"They're tearing all those building down now and it's just a bunch of ugly steel buildings and nothing special any more.\"\n\n\"I see…\" says the man. \"Well, at least we can go to the Vatican and see the Pope! Were both very religious and are extremely excited to see him!\"\n\n\"Ahh, don't bother\" says the barber yet again. \"It's usually so crowded that you'll be lucky if you can just see the tip of his hat! The whole thing sounds like a waste of time to me.\"\n\nDespite the barber's crude warnings, the man takes his wife and they both go to Rome.\n\nA few weeks later, the man goes back to the barber's to get another haircut and, once again, they start chatting. The man tells the barber that he has just gotten back from his trip to Rome with his wife.\n\n\"Oh, and how was the food there?\" Asks the barber.\n\n\"It was great! There were giants platters full of all sorts of pasta's everywhere! We had authentic gelato after every meal, some of the best espresso's I've ever had and more delicious food in that week then I've ever had in my life!\"\n\n\"That sounds nice\" says the barber. \"What about the buildings?\"\n\n\"They were stunning! We barely had time to see half of the amazing sights that Rome had to offer. We saw the Colosseum, walked all around the beautiful Villa Borghese, visited the Capuchin Crypts, and we visited all the famous Piazza's we could!\"\n\n\"I see!\" replies the barber. \"And the Pope?\"\n\n\"Well, we went to the Vatican and there was a huge sea of people. From the Pope's balcony, we could just about see the tip of his hat. Suddenly, he raised his rod and pointed it right at me and my wife, and the crowd parted in two and made a pathway. He looked right at me and shouted ‘YOU!' and started to make his way towards me. He then slowly walked right up to my face and said ‘…who the FUCK gave you that haircut?'\"\n",

      "title": "Hell's Food",
      "joke": "Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.\n\nHe wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate everyday waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angel dust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n",

As they entered their late teens the girls dated, and on this particular evening all three of his girls were going out on a date. This was the first time this had occurred. As was his custom, he would greet the young suitor at the door holding his shotgun, not to menace or threaten but merely to ensure that the young man knew who was boss.\n\nThe doorbell rang and the first of the boys arrived. Father answered the door and the lad said, \"Hi, my name's Joe, I'm here for Flo. We're going to the show, is she ready to go?\" The father looked him over and sent the kids on their way.\n\nThe next lad arrived and said, \"My name's Eddie, I'm here for Betty, we're gonna get some spaghetti, is she ready?\" Father felt this one was okay too, so off the two kids went.\n\nThe final young man arrived and the farmer opened the door. The boy started off, \"Hi, my name's Chuck… --\" and the farmer shot him.\n",

When he gets to that section I'll get a buzz on my phone and we can head back.\"\n\nEveryone thinks that this is brilliant so they knock back a few more pints before suddenly the lead bass stands up and announces it's time to go.

So they slip through, pick up their instruments and look up at the conductor and...he is angry.\n\nSuper angry.\n\nReady to bust a blood vessel angry.\n\nBut you would be too wouldn't you?

He's in his third year, and after a particularly tough day, he gets an invite from one of his onion-friends to a party they're having that evening. Being tired and weary, the lawyer-onion isn't sure whether to go, but decides he needs cheering up. So he dresses smartly, puts on his favorite aftershave, and heads over to his friend's. He gets to the party to find it quite a packed affair, and heads over to the bar - fighting through crowds of reveller-onions - to get a drink. As he gets to the bar, he notices in one corner a slightly out-of-place female onion. She looks a bit sad, and being the compassionate onion that he is, he heads over to talk to her.\n\nThis is quickly affirmed as a good move, as they hit it off immediately; she was abandoned by her friends shortly after arriving, and had been minding her own business ever since, but over a night of drinks and talking, they quickly fall into an infatuation and soon end up spending an oniony night of passion together.\n\nWhen they awake in the morning, they don't find it awkward, and a steady relationship between the two is struck. This lasts a good while, having its ups and downs like any college relationship, but eventually the day comes when they both graduate. The two couldn't be happier! They both get jobs close to one another and move into a flat together.\n\nOne day, the partner-onion is anxiously awaiting the lawyer-onion at home. She's been ill all day, and checking has confirmed her suspicions. She tearfully - and joyfully - breaks the news to the lawyer-onion; they're going to have a tiny baby-onion together. A shallot, if you will. A few days later, this prompts the lawyer-onion to propose to his heretofore girlfriend-onion. They are soon wed, having a fantastic wedding-day, and husband and wife-onions are on top of the world.\n\nThe day comes of the birth, and no complications - a tiny, healthy baby onion is born to two proud parents. Seeing this little bundle of oniony love in their arms causes them to fall deeper in love than ever.\n\nOver the next few years, husband-and-wife-onions' lives are fantastic. He's prospering at work, she's really enjoying taking some time to raise the baby-onion, and over time the baby-onion grows into a hale and hearty toddler-onion, who then becomes a child-onion.\n\nOne day, the idyll of the onions' lives is shattered when tragedy strikes.\n\nThe lawyer-onion (now a partner-onion in a prestigious law firm due to chance and hard work) is at work, and mother-onion is washing dishes and watching her child play in the yard. She glances away to take another plate, and turns her vision back to the yard just in time to see her child wander into the adjacent road and get hit by a massive freight lorry.\n\nShe screams, runs out, and calls an ambulance. The ambulance comes and rushes the frail child-onion to the Onion Hospital. Being in such a critical condition, he is rushed straight into the operating theatre, and mummy-and-daddy onion can do little but wait outside the theatre hoping for some news. After an agonising five-hour wait, the weary-looking doctor-onion emerges in surgical garb, ready to impart news.\n\n\"So, Mr and Mrs Onion. Would you like the good news or the bad news?\"\n\nThe couple ponder it for a moment, and then decide: \"The good news, please.\"\n\nThe doctor-onion regards them briefly, and then says, \"Well, the good news is we've managed to stabilise your child. The bad news is... he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of his life.\"",

In a last ditch effort to stop the bloodshed, the two leaders decided that in 10 years time, a dogfight would take place. The winning dog's nation would win the war, and become the supreme nation.\n\nIn Russia, Dog breeders worked with biologists, crossbreeding different species of wolves, trying to make the toughest, meanest, and deadliest dog to ever live. The dog was given steroids, fed with small animals, and had to be contained in a steel cage in order to keep it's handlers safe. People were afraid of this dog. There was no way whatever the Americans were doing could have possibly been stronger than this beast.\n\nFinally, on May 25th, 2145, the dogs, their handlers, and the nations' leaders arranged to have the dogfight.\n\nWhen the Russian dog was released, it burst into the arena, ready to kill. A few moments later, a large wooden crate with air holes was carried to arena, and opened. What emerged was pathetic. Out waddled an 8 foot long Weiner dog, that looked like it just woke up. It must have weighed 400 pounds, and was very clearly not in the best shape. The a Russian dog pounced, tearing chunks off of the Weiner dog with each bite. Finally, in one swift motion, the Weiner dog wraps around it's opponent, opens it's moth, and swallowed it's prey in one bite.\n\nThe Russian president opened his mouth to speak, but had no words. Finally, after a few minutes of dumbfounded silence, he says \"But.. how? We spent millions of dollars creating that beast. It could not be beaten.\" The US president simply shrugged and said \"while you were busy doing that, we had our best plastic surgeons try to make a crocodile look like a dog.\"",

      "title": "Priest and Half a Lemon",
      "joke": "There was once a priest who went to travel the world after taking his oath. After years of travelling he arrived in a little village far from civilization. The village didn't have a church, the villagers went to the nearest town if they wanted to worship God, it was more than 25 kilometres away.\n\nThe priest sought the Church for monetary support and with help from the locals they built their own chuch. From there on, he was giving sermons and masses on Sunday, joining young couples in Holy Matrinomy, and giving prayers at funerals.\n\nThis went on for many years.\n\nOn an ordinary Sunday at the end of the mass, the priest was herding the people out of the church and he was ready to close the gates when a raggedy man approached him.\n\nThe raggedy man in his dirty and torn clothes stood before the priest and said this to him:\n\n\"Priest, please be good and give half a lemon\" - said the man. The priest was a good man but he thought that the request was a bit odd. He went back inside, cut a lemon in half and gave it to the man.\n\nThe priest's curiosity was peaked. The priest asked the ruggeddy man:\n\n\"My son, tell me, why do you need half a lemon?\"\n\nThe man with horror on his face quickly took off before the priest was given an answer.\n\nA week later the ruggedy man returned, and he met the priest at the same place. The ruggedy man said to the priest:\n\n\"Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon\"\n\nThe priest was taken aback by the man and his strange request. The priest was good, so he went back inside, cut a lemon in half, and gave it to the stranger and immediatly asked:\n\n\"My son, tell me please, why do you need these lemons?\" The strange man immediately took off, but the priest wasn't giving up easy and he went after the stranger. The priest couldn't keep up with the ruggedy man, because he wasn't in the greatest condition, he almost fainted.\n\nThe priest hoped that the strange man would come back next week, so he could know why he needed those lemons.\n\nThe priest spent the next week running and training, so he could keep up with the strange man. Sure enough, the training paid off because the man was back on the next Sunday and asked the priest:\n\n\"Priest, please be good and give me half a lem-\"\n\nThe priest didn't even wait for him to finish his sentence he immediately gave half a lemon to the strange man.\n\n\"Thank you priest, you are good\" - said the stranger. \"Don't even mention,my child, but tell me, why do you need all these lemons?\"\n\nThe man ran away with terror in his eyes, but the priest was in pursuit of him. They were running for a long time when they reached a river. The stranger, without hesitation, leapt in to the river and swam to the other shore and ran away. The priest didn't follow him because he couldn't swim.\n\nHe went home fuming. The priest spent the next week taking swimming lessons in the nearest town's swimming pool.\n\nThe next week at the same time the strange man arrived again.\n\n\"Priest, please be good and give half a lemon\" The priest went in the back, put in his running shoes and swimming trunks and came out with half a lemon and gave it to the man.\n\n\"Here you go my son, but could you please tell why do you need it?\"\n\nThe strange man quickly started running, they ran and ran and ran until they arrived at the river. The man quickly jumped into the river and swam across it, the priest was right behind him, those swimming lessons finally paid off!\n\nThey started to run again until they arrived at tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man with cat like agility climbed the tall tree. The priest didn't follow because he didn't know how to climb trees. He went home cursing at everything.\n\nHe spent the next week climbing the tree in the churchyard much to the amusment of the villagers. Before Sunday's mass he put on his swimming trunks and his swimming shorts. The priest was good and he even prepared the lemon and put it in his pocket.\n\nThe mass finished much earlier than usual, so he could warm up. As soon as he finished his warmup the strange man approached him yet again. The priest gave him the lemon immediately.\n\n\"My son, for God's sake, tell me why do you need lemons?\"\n\nThe man quickly ran off, the priest was right behind him. They ran to the river and swam across, ran to the ravine and climbed the tree. The priest almost caught him when the stranger grabbed a vine and swung across the ravine. The priest was about to have a brain aneurysm when saw another vine. He quickly grabbed it and swung across the deep ravine. When he got to the other side he suddenly encountered another unexpected obstacle. He arrived in a plane graveyard. The strange locked himself inside one of the grounded planes. The priest went around the plane multiple times but he couldn't find a way inside. He was enraged.\n\nNext week he spent everyday at the village's locksmith, studying every method of opening a lock.\n\nNext Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back a waterproof backpack. In the backpack there was a crowbar, wrench, cutting torch, even lockpicks.\n\nThe strange man arrive yet again and asked for the same thing. The priest quickly gave it to him and grabbed his wrists, looked into his terrified eyes and asked him:\n\n\"What do you need these lemons for?\"\n\nThe stranger started to panic and broke free from the priest. They raced to the river, swam across it, they ran to the ravine and swung across it, but the man locked himself inside another airplane. But the priest didn't stop he quickly got all his tools out of his waterproof backpack and started to work on the lock. Not an hour passed he was inside of the plane. Inside, the ruggedy man was crouched in a corner with horror on his face and terror in his eyes.\n\nThe good priest crouched down next to him and kindly asked:\n\n\"Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?\"\n\n\"Alright priest\" - said the strange man in a trembling voice - \"I will tell you but please be good and don't tell anyone\"\n\nThe priest was good and didn't tell anyone.",

Shortly after the new Pope is enthroned, the Chief Rabbi seeks an audience. He is shown into the Pope's presence, whereupon he presents the Pope with a silver tray bearing a velvet cushion. On top of the cushion is an ancient, shriveled parchment envelope. The Pope symbolically stretches out his arm in a gesture of rejection. The Chief Rabbi then retires, taking the envelope with him and does not return until the next Pope is elected.\n\nPope Francis was intrigued by this ritual, that's origins were unknown to him. He instructed the best scholars of the Vatican to research it, but they came up with nothing. When the time came and the Chief Rabbi was shown into his presence, he faithfully enacted the ritual rejection but, as the Chief Rabbi turned to leave, he called him back.\n\n\"My brother,\" the Pope whispered, \"I must confess that we Catholics are ignorant of the meaning of this ritual enacted for centuries between us and you, the representative of the Jewish people. I have to ask you, what is it all about?\"\n\nThe Chief Rabbi shrugs and replies: \"But we have no more idea than you do. The origin of the ceremony is lost in the traditions of ancient history.\"\n\nThe Pope said: \"Let us retire to my private chambers and enjoy a glass of wine together, then with your agreement, we shall open the envelope and discover the secret at last.\"\n\nThe Chief Rabbi agreed. Fortified in their resolve by the wine, they gingerly pried open the curling parchment envelope and with trembling fingers, the Chief Rabbi reached inside and extracted a folded sheet of similarly ancient paper. As the Pope peered over his shoulder, he slowly opened it. They both gasped with shock - It was the check for the Last Supper.",

Equally unfortunate, my wife is like most women - she loves to browse.\n\nYesterday my dear wife received the following letter from the local Target:\n\nDear Mrs. Harris,\n\nOver the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion in our store. We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to ban both of you from the store. Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:\n\nJune 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.\n\nJuly 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.\n\nJuly 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.\n\nJuly 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, ‘Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away'. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time and costing the company money.\n\nAugust 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&Ms on layaway.\n\nAugust 14: Moved a ‘CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.\n\nAugust 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.\n\nAugust 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, ‘Why can't you people just leave me alone?' EMTs were called.\n\nSeptember 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.\n\nSeptember 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.\n\nOctober 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while loudly humming the ‘ Mission Impossible' theme.\n\nOctober 6: In the auto department, he practiced his ‘Madonna look' by using different sizes of funnels.\n\nOctober 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled ‘PICK ME! PICK ME!'\n\nOctober 21: When an announcement came over the loudspeaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed ‘OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!'\n\nAnd last, but not least:\n\n15. October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile, then yelled very loudly, ‘Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.'\nOne of the clerks passed out.",

      "joke": "A woman visited an Amazonian tribe on a research trip...\n\nShe spent several days taking notes on the lifestyle and habits of the tribe and interviewing their ruler, King Paolo, via an interpreter. As the tribe's land was near several rich gold mines, the king and his people were extremely wealthy.\n\nDuring the woman's time with him, the king fell hopelessly in love with her, as she was very beautiful. When it came time for her to leave to return to the United States, the king called her into his palace and spoke passionately to her via the interpreter.\n\n\"King Paolo begs you to remain here and be his wife. He will grant you any three requests within his power; whatever you ask will be yours.\"\n\nFlattered but not desiring to remain in the Amazon forever, the woman decided to ask for impossible favors to avoid having to turn the king down and hurt his feelings. \"Tell the king that I accept, but if he cannot fulfill my three requests, I must leave immediately. My first wish is for a 50-carat diamond engagement ring and 25-carat bracelets and necklaces to match.\"\n\nWhen the request was relayed to him, the king nodded without hesitation and responded in primitive English: \"Okay, okay! I buy, I buy!\"\n\nThe woman frowned, not expecting the king to be able to fulfill the ask. She decided to make the next request truly impossible: \"My second wish is to live in a home exactly like this one.\" She pulled up her phone and displayed a picture of a nine-figure Beverly Hills mansion with three pools, gatehouses, acres of perfectly landscaped property, indoor basketball courts and theatre rooms, the whole nine yards.\n\nWhen the interpreter explained the request to the king, he waved his hand and nodded eagerly. \"Okay, okay, I build! I build!\"\n\nHe motioned to his nearby advisors, who immediately contacted the finest architects in Brazil to consult on the project. In exchange for several tons of gold, the architects designed an identical residence and brought in several construction companies to begin work immediately. They brought in solar panels and hydroelectric units to power the buildings. Paying triple the usual rate, the king had land cleared and construction completed within days. It was some real Extreme Makeover: Home Edition shit.\n\nDumbfounded and a bit concerned, as she still had no desire to remain in the rainforest for the rest of her life, the woman went before the king with her final request, determined to come up with something that no amount of money could provide. \"Tell the king that the man I marry must have a penis that's 12 inches long.\"\n\nLooking horrified, King Paolo arose from his throne and strode around the room muttering to himself, first angrily and then sadly. He seemed to be thinking desperately, searching for options. But finally, he shook his head sadly, and spoke in a tone of resignation: \"Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.\"",
